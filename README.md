# Input-NASM
This program takes user input and checks its length, if the length is less than five characters it prints “Your name has less than 5 characters”, if its more it says “Your name has more than 5 characters”. The way this was done was to check if the character amount was less than 5 first because if not it will go to the next line, and then check if its more. If I checked if it was more than 5 characters first, then it would always say there is more than 5 characters and never say it is less than 5 characters.
